# VBA-challenge

This challenge was very difficult because of the lack of error messaging.  I had all of my code in place but kept failing to get the data pulled correctly.  Turns out it was because of a misspelling on the variable 'columnindex'.

But because it forced me to examine all of my code I better understood how everything was working to get the final result.  

Thanks
